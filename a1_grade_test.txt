This is a doctest based regression suite for assignment1.py
Each '>>' line is run as if in a python shell, and counts as a test.
The next line, if not '>>' is the expected output of the previous line.
If anything doesn't match exactly (including trailing spaces), the test fails.

Import the functions
>>> from assignment1 import grade

Test the grading code
>>> grade(0, True)
E
>>> grade(40, True)
D
>>> grade(45, True)
D
>>> grade(50, True)
C
>>> grade(55, True)
C
>>> grade(55, False)
K
>>> grade(66, True)
B
>>> grade(66, False)
K
>>> grade(76, False)
K
>>> grade(76, True)
B
>>> grade(86, True)
A
>>> grade(86, False)
K
>>> grade(0.0,True)
Invalid mark
>>> grade(0.0,False)
Invalid mark
>>> grade(0,"dsafdsfd")
Invalid mcr
