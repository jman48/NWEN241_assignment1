This is a doctest based regression suite for assignment1.py
Each '>>' line is run as if in a python shell, and counts as a test.
The next line, if not '>>' is the expected output of the previous line.
If anything doesn't match exactly (including trailing spaces), the test fails.

Import the functions
>>> from assignment1 import pythagoras

Test the pythagoras code
>>> pythagoras(3,4)
5.0
>>> pythagoras(4,3)
5.0
>>> pythagoras(0,3)
First leg is invalid
>>> pythagoras(3,0)
Second leg is invalid
>>> pythagoras(3,3)
4.2
>>>
