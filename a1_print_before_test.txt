This is a doctest based regression suite for assignment1.py
Each '>>' line is run as if in a python shell, and counts as a test.
The next line, if not '>>' is the expected output of the previous line.
If anything doesn't match exactly (including trailing spaces), the test fails.

Import the functions
>>> from assignment1 import print_before

Test the list problem:
>>> print_before(["a","b","c"],"b")
['a']
>>> print_before(["a","b","c"],"c")
['a', 'b']
>>> print_before(["a","b","c"],"")
['a', 'b', 'c']
>>> print_before([],"")
[]
>>> print_before([],"a")
[]
>>> print_before([],[])
Expected a string
>>> print_before([],"a")
[]
>>> print_before("","a")
Expected a list of words
