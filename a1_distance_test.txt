This is a doctest based regression suite for assignment1.py
Each '>>' line is run as if in a python shell, and counts as a test.
The next line, if not '>>' is the expected output of the previous line.
If anything doesn't match exactly (including trailing spaces), the test fails.

Import the functions
>>> from assignment1 import distance

Test the distance calculation
>>> for t in range(0,10):
...     distance(t,9.8)
